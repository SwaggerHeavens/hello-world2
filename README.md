Well, this is the second time my smart ass is trying to understand the whole deal about Git and GitHub cause it appears very crucial that I understand this.

Well, now since this is sort of a different version to the original 'request' (Is that right?) (Yeah the master request). Um no I think this is called a branch. damn c'mon brain. Anyway, the stuff I write here won't appear in the 'master' branch until I decide to 'commit' the stuff am writing. Yeah I am still learning the terminology.
